#========Building and Running===============================
# Below are 5 main instructions for building, running and testing.
# You don't need elixir or node, just docker and docker-compose is required   
# Run from the tiny directory
# This bring elixir into your system and try to get the deps for tiny-api
1. docker-compose run elixir deps.get deps.compile compile
# This build the backend image
2. docker-compose build backend
# This build the frontend image
3. docker-compose build frontend
# Run "docker-compose up" twice for the first time you run it
# subsequently can be run once
4. docker-compose up 
# DB, backend and frontend should be up and you can access the graph-api and frontend at
# http://localhost:4000/api/graphiql and http://localhost:3000/ respectively

#======== Testing (Note: pls Build first) ===============================
# To Run all test you can run command below (Note: you must be successful with above steps to run test)
# Like "docker-compose up" you should run it twice the first time because it will be doing lots of stuff the first time
5. docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yaml up
